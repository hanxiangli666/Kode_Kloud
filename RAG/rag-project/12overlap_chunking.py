# 1) 该脚本演示切块重叠如何保留上下文; This script demonstrates how chunk overlap preserves context.
# 2) 它实现了无重叠与有重叠切分的对比输出; It implements a side-by-side comparison of overlap settings.
# 3) 使用的 AI 技术是文本切分策略优化，为向量检索提升召回; The AI technique is chunking strategy tuning for better retrieval.
# 4) 在学习路径中，它是从基础切分走向质量提升的一步; In the learning path, it is a quality-improvement step beyond basics.
# 5) 它与 basic_chunking.py 和 sentence_chunking.py 形成渐进式改进链条; It forms a progressive improvement chain with basic and sentence chunking.
