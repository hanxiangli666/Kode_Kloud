      "has exacerbated the tension between security and civil liberties. A poignant example\n",

      "that scraping billions of public images helps law enforcement solve crimes, privacy\n",
      "advocates contend that this constitutes a violation of anonymity (Hill, 2020). As\n",

      "greater good of collective security, and deontological perspectives, which view\n",
      "privacy as an inviolable duty that cannot be traded away.\n",

      "unchecked normalization of surveillance technologies risks shifting democratic norms\n",
      "by redefining privacy from a fundamental right into a conditional privilege granted by\n",
