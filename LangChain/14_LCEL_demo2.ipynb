      "**Forrest Gump** is a 1994 American drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis and based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The film stars Tom Hanks as the title character, Forrest Gump, a kind-hearted man with a low IQ and an extraordinary life story.\n",
      "\n",
      "The narrative follows Forrest from his childhood in Alabama, where he faces challenges due to his mental limitations, but also possesses a unique ability to connect with people and experience life in a distinctive way. His mother, played by Sally Field, encourages him to pursue happiness, instilling in him the belief that \"life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the film, Forrest unwittingly becomes involved in several significant historical events in the United States during the 20th century, including the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, and the rise of the tech industry. He meets several iconic figures and impacts their lives, often in ways he doesn’t fully understand. The film also features a poignant love story between Forrest and his childhood friend Jenny Curran, played by Robin Wright, who struggles with her own challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forrest's journey is marked by themes of destiny, the simplicity of love and friendship, and the unpredictability of life. The film is known for its groundbreaking visual effects, particularly in how it integrates Forrest into archival footage of historical events.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Forrest Gump\" was a critical and commercial success, winning six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Tom Hanks, and Best Director for Robert Zemeckis. Its blend of humor, emotion, and memorable quotes has made it a cultural phenomenon, and it remains one of the most beloved films in cinema history.\n",
