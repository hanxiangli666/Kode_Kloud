      "*\"Forrest Gump\"* is a 1994 American drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis, based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The film stars Tom Hanks in the title role, alongside Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story follows Forrest Gump, a man with a low IQ but an extraordinary heart and an unyielding spirit. Despite his mental challenges, he unwittingly influences several historical events in the 20th century while pursuing his childhood sweetheart, Jenny Curran, played by Robin Wright. The narrative is structured as a series of flashbacks, with Forrest recounting his life story while sitting on a bench at a bus stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forrest's journey takes him through pivotal moments in American history, including the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights Movement, and the rise of technology and pop culture, all while showcasing his various accomplishments, such as becoming a college football star, a war hero, and a successful entrepreneur with his shrimping business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film explores themes of destiny, love, friendship, and the impact of historical events on individual lives. It is noted for its innovative use of visual effects to integrate Forrest into historical footage and its iconic quotes, such as \"Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*Forrest Gump* received critical acclaim and won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Tom Hanks, and Best Director for Robert Zemeckis. It has since become a cultural touchstone, celebrated for its storytelling, emotional depth, and memorable soundtrack.\n",
