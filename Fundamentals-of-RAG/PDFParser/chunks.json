    "text": "The Fable of Fiona the Fussy Feline  Fiona, a tuxedo cat of considerable ﬂuff and questionable temper, believed the world revolved entirely around the timely provision of tuna in springwater, not brine. She lived with a human named Bernard, a kind but perpetually confused soul who often purchased the wrong variety. \"Mrow?\" Fiona would inquire, delicately batting a paw at the offensive can, a dramatic sigh escaping her tiny pink nose. The sound was less a plea and more a deeply felt existential critique of Bernard's life choices. The Sardine Incident",

    "text": "🐟 One Tuesday, Bernard, running late for his competitive bird-watching group, grabbed a can marked 'Sardines in Oil.' A rookie mistake. Fiona's reaction was immediate and theatrical. She didn't just refuse the food; she treated the bowl as a biohazard, circling it with a low, menacing growl that vibrated the kitchen tiles. Bernard's Excuse: \"They were on a special, Fiona! And they have extra Omega-3s!\" Fiona rolled onto her back, exposing her belly—a risky maneuver that usually signalled trust—but this time it was a power move.

The Great Bedtime Conspiracy \tFiona's true genius lay in her nighttime agenda. Every 3:17 AM, she would launch 'Operation: Human Disturbance.'

This involved three phases: 1 The Silent Stare: Perching on the bedside table and silently judging Bernard until he woke up from sheer psychic pressure. 2 The Corner Attack: Viciously attacking an imaginary foe in the darkest corner of the room, making sounds like a tiny, dying lawnmower. 3 The Nose Nudge: A soft, cold, wet nose tap directly to Bernard's open eyeball. A guaranteed wake-up call. Bernard eventually installed a miniature security camera just to catch her in the act. The footage revealed her practicing yoga poses before beginning the operation. She was a methodical maniac.   Moral of the Story?  The moral of Fiona’s tale, whispered amongst the other neighborhood pets (who were less demanding), is simple: Never underestimate the passive-aggressive power of a creature that can sleep for 20 hours a day and still demand respect. Also, always double-check the label—brine is a betrayal. The end.",
